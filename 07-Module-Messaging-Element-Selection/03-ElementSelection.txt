Cross origin:
  1. When there are cross origin iframes in the host application we need to
    configure them in admin/mainfest.json in order to load the player bundle in that iframe.
  2. We don't support cors-origin iframes in injected player as we can not access cross-origin iframes from main window


Element Selection:
  1. Pinking Element from host application:
    We use optimal select library for selecting element
    a. selector: actual element Selection
    b. containers: ['parent1Selector', 'parent2Selector', etc.,]
    c. frames: ['frame1' , 'frame1_subframe1']
    Flow Steps:
    1. Send the steps to all the frames.
    2. identify frame.
    3. identify element
        a. will check container score for 75% match
        b. check for element using selector.

  2. CSS Selector / XPATH / custom script
    a. selector/script
    b. iframePath
    Flow Steps:
    1. Send the steps to all the frames.
    2. identify frame.
    3. identify element
